When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

```text
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 25
Total: $2561231
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
```

Your final code should print the analysis to the console.

**Hints:**

- You will need to do some research on your own for this project!

- Remember, in order to combine strings and variables in the console you will need to use **concatenation**.

- How do you only print to the nearest 100th in JavaScript?
